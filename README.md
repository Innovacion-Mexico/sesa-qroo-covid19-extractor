# Extractor Metrics From Sesa Official Webpage
A simple solution to extract and save all the metrics from the official website of SESA (State Health Services) of Quintana Roo, Mexico.

Visit also [docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/etejeda/sesa-qroo-covid19-extractor).

## How works?

Basically the information is extracted with the 'BeautifulSoup' utility using html, and then it is deposited in a postgresql database with the help of the ORM peewee.

## Requirements

* Docker Engine (for running container version ). :heart:
* Python3 (peewee, urlrequest, beatifulsoup, dotenv)
* PostgresSQL Database

## Getting Started

### Standalone

You only run this command in your terminal:

```
docker run \
-e DATABASE=${env.DATABASE} \
-e DB_USER=${USERNAME} \
-e DB_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD} \
-e DB_HOST=${env.DB_HOSTNAME} \
-e URL_SESA=${env.URL_SESA} etejeda/sesa-qroo-covid19-extractor:latest
```

or just create a file naming `.env` and put the env vars inside:

```
DATABASE=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=5432
URL_SESA=https://salud.qroo.gob.mx/portal/coronavirus/coronavirus.php
```

and then run the container in your terminal:

```
docker run --env-file YOUR-ENV-FILE etejeda/sesa-qroo-covid19-extractor:latest
```
### Schedule task

#### Jenkins

For more security, first add the user & password of db like secrets (like secret username/password) and then you need add a step in your pipeline executing the container image, example:

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        cron('H/15 * * * *')
    }
    environment {
        DATABASE = ''
        DB_PORT = '3306'
        DB_HOSTNAME = ''
        URL_SESA = 'https://salud.qroo.gob.mx/portal/coronavirus/coronavirus.php'
        CREDENTIALS = ''
    }
    stages {
        stage('Update DB') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: env.CREDENTIALS, usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD')]) {
                    sh " docker run -e DATABASE=${env.DATABASE} \
                        -e DB_USER=${USERNAME} \
                        -e DB_PASSWORD=${PASSWORD} \
                        -e DB_HOST=${env.DB_HOSTNAME} \
                        -e URL_SESA=${env.URL_SESA} etejeda/sesa-qroo-covid19-extractor:latest"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Development
### Building the container

I provided a makefile for do this job, only run this command:
```
make run build 
```

### Environment Variables 

| Name  | Description  | Default | Required |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| DATABASE| Database name | - | *yes* |
| DB_USER | Username of database | - | *yes* |
| DB_PASSWORD | Password for database | - | *yes* |
| DB_HOST | Hostname or IP for the database | - | *yes* |
| DB_PORT |  Port number for the database | `5432` | no |
| URL_SESA | The current url for extract all metricts (SESA webpage) | - | *yes* |
